# AI Voice Assistant Chat History

## Project Summary
This project is an AI Voice Assistant that allows users to have conversations with an AI through speech. The application includes real-time speech-to-text, AI processing, and text-to-speech capabilities.

## Implementation History

### Initial Implementation
- Created a web interface with microphone recording functionality
- Implemented backend server with Flask for processing audio
- Added AI response generation using Groq API
- Implemented text-to-speech for AI responses

### UI Simplification
- Removed all buttons except the "Send" button to simplify the interface
- Updated UI state management to work with the simplified controls

### Microphone Permission Fix
- Identified issue: Users experiencing "Could not access microphone" errors
- Solution: Replaced direct microphone recording with Web Speech API
- Modified frontend to use speech recognition without requiring microphone permissions
- Added new backend endpoint `/process_text` to handle text input directly
- Updated UI text and workflow to reflect the new approach

## Current Features
- Real-time speech recognition using Web Speech API
- Text processing with AI (Groq API)
- Text-to-speech for AI responses
- Simplified UI with only a "Send" button
- Support for both Hindi and English languages

## How to Use
1. Click the microphone to start listening
2. Speak your message
3. Click the microphone again to stop listening
4. Click the "Send" button to send your transcribed text to the AI
5. The AI will process your text and respond with both text and audio

## Technical Notes
- Backend: Python with Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AI: Groq API with gemma2-9b-it model
- TTS: A4F local TTS
- Speech Recognition: Web Speech API
